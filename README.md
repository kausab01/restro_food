# 🌮 Mauli VadaPav Billing System (Java Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Console-Based Food Ordering and Billing System** developed using **Core Java**.
It simulates a small fast-food shop named **“Mauli VadaPav”**, where users can select menu items, choose quantity (Half / Full), and generate the final bill.

The program demonstrates how real-world hotel/food billing systems can be implemented using basic Java programming concepts.
